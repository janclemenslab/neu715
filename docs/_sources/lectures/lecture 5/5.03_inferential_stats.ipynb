    "# Inferential statistics\n",
    "Often, we are not only interested in describing our data with descriptive statistics like the mean and standard deviation, but want to know whether two or more sets of measurements are likely to come from the same underlying distribution. We want to draw inferences from the data. This is what inferential statistics is about.\n",

    "To test whether a new wonder drug increases the eye sight, Linda and Anabel ran the following experiment with student subjects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimental subjects were injected a saline solution containing 1nM of the wonder drug. Control subjects were injected saline without the drug. \n",
    "To assess the effect of the drug, eye sight was scored by testing the subjects' ability to read small text within one hour of drug injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Linda and Anabel used two different experimental designs:\n",
    "1. Linda tested 100 students. 50 were injected saline only (control) and 50 were given the drug (treatment).\n",
    "2. Anabel only tested 50 students. She measured the eye sight in each subject twice: before and after the injection.\n",

    "Our task is now to determine whether the wonder drug really improves eye sight as tested in these two sets of experiments."
