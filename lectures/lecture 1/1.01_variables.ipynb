    "Working with numeric values directly isn't very general, since you tie your code to specific numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are a way to make your code more general (and thereby more useful), by separating specific data values from the general computation. You can think of the variable as a storage container: it can store information that you can access via its name and manipulate in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is created with the syntax `name = value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `name` can be any combination of characters, underscores and numbers (as long as it does not start with a number)\n",
    "- `value` can be a number, text (or an arbitrary \"python object\").\n",
    "\n",
    "That way, you can express your program's computation in general terms - as the manipulation of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "> What is a Variable? In computer programming, a variable has a name and contains a value. A variable is like a box. If you labeled the box as `toys` and put a yo-yo inside it, in programming terms, `toys` is the variable name, and yo-yo is the value.\n",

    "Take the ingredients in a cake recipe as an analogy: A recipe typically contains eggs as an ingredient and contains an instruction like _\"Add eggs\"_. But what if we want to bake a vegan cake?\n",
    "\n",
    "Eggs play specific role in the recipe - for instance, they enrich the flavor and add moisture. We can make a general recipe by replacing the specific ingredient, \"eggs\", in a recipe with its role, \"flavor\": _\"Add flavor\"_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example the variable name is `flavor`. In a receipe for an old-fashioned cake, the variable `flavor` has the value `\"eggs\"`: \n",

    "### Computing firing rates\n",
    "Back to neuroscience: Say we want to compute the firing rate of a neuron. We have counted the number of spikes (132) our neuron fired during a recording of 16 seconds. The firing rate - the number of spikes per second (1/s=Hz) - is given by the ratio of both:"
