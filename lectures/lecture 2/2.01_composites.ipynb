    "# Tuples and dictionaries\n",
    "Lists are also called _collections_, because they are a collection of different things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has more types of collections:\n",
    "- `tuple` - read-only (immutable) variant of a list. Functions that return multiple results return them as tuples. Rarely used.\n",
    "- `dict` - dictionary, for non-ordered collections, like phone books. Consists of key-value pairs (in a phone book: names are the keys, the phone numbers the values). Keys act as indices, but in contrast to lists, are unordered and can be of arbitrary type, for instance, strings. Dictionaries are also called \"mappings\" since they maps keys to values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tuples\n",
    "Tuples can be created by enclosing tuple items in parentheses (not square brackets as for lists):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "__Caution__: The parentheses are pure decoration - it's the comma that makes a tuple. For instance, a trailing comma after a value is sufficient to generate a tuple - this is a frequent cause for bugs. But always use parentheses to clearly indicate in your code that you are defining a tuple!"
